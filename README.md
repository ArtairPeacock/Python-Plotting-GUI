Python GUI for plotting Excel data
An interactive GUI to allow a user to choose which .xlsx file to use when plotting data.
For the moment, this first version of the program only allows one to plot 2 dimensional data.

To use this program, first select the .xlsx file with the "Browse Files" button. 
After a file has been selected, load the data using "Load 2D Data" button.
Finally, press "Plot 2D Data" button to plot the data which uses matplotlib to plot the loaded data.
